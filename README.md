# TipCalculator
Practiced Swift development by creating a tip calculating app to practice dealing with optionals, classes, segues and navigation for multi-screen apps. Tell the app how many people there are and how much you want to tip and it will calculate each persons bill.

Developed by using logic learned from a course by the London App Brewery
